## **Product Requirements Document: Resilient AI Workflow Engine**

Author: Gemini

Date: September 8, 2025

Version: 1.0

Status: Proposed

### **1\. Introduction & Vision**

1.1. The Problem

The development of AI-powered applications, particularly those involving multi-step reasoning and interaction with external tools, has been accelerated by frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph. However, moving these applications from prototype to production reveals significant reliability gaps. Most example projects focus on simple, synchronous request-response chains, neglecting the realities of enterprise systems: processes can be long-running, failures are inevitable, and human oversight is non-negotiable for critical tasks. An experienced backend engineer attempting to build a robust AI system today must manually architect solutions for state management, fault tolerance, and human interventionâ€”complex tasks that are not native to most AI frameworks.

1.2. The Vision

To create a definitive, open-source reference implementation for building resilient, enterprise-grade AI workflows using LangGraph. This project will provide a powerful and practical template that demonstrates how to architect stateful, asynchronous, and fault-tolerant systems with seamless "human-in-the-loop" (HITL) capabilities.

1.3. Positioning

This is not another AI chatbot demo. It is a production-ready pattern for developers. We are building a lightweight, AI-native business process automation (BPA) engine. It is designed for mission-critical tasks where accuracy, auditability, and the ability to recover from failure are paramount. It serves as a bridge between the worlds of distributed systems engineering and applied AI.

### **2\. Target Audience & Personas**

* **Primary Persona (The Builder): Alex, The Experienced Backend Engineer**  
  * **Background:** 10+ years in Java/Go/Python, building scalable, distributed systems. Understands databases, message queues, and stateful architecture.  
  * **Goal:** Wants to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate complex business logic but is skeptical of the "black box" nature and fragility of typical AI demos. Alex needs to see patterns for reliability, observability, and control before deploying such a system.  
  * **Needs:** Well-documented code, clear architectural patterns, and features that map to familiar concepts like persistence, transactions, and event-driven flows.  
* **Secondary Persona (The Adopter): Maria, The AI/ML Engineer**  
  * **Background:** Proficient in building models and using frameworks like LangChain. Strong in Python and data science but less experienced with production infrastructure and long-running systems.  
  * **Goal:** Wants to productionize his complex, multi-step agentic workflows.  
  * **Needs:** A practical example of how to handle state and human feedback over long periods, moving beyond the limitations of in-memory solutions.

### **3\. Guiding Principles & Strategy**

* **Reliability First:** The architecture must prioritize resilience and fault tolerance. A crash should never result in lost work.  
* **Clarity and Simplicity:** The project must be a learning tool. The code and documentation should be exceptionally clear, serving as the "aha\!" moment for engineers new to these concepts in LangGraph.  
* **Practicality over Complexity:** For V1, we will solve a real-world problem (document validation) using the simplest effective stack (SQLite, Streamlit) to maximize accessibility and minimize setup friction.  
* **Open and Extensible:** The design should be modular, making it easy for the community to adapt the engine for new use cases or integrate different backends in the future.

### **4\. Use Cases & Scope**

**4.1. Core Use Case: Asynchronous Document Processing & Validation**

* **Example A: Invoice Processing**  
  * **Ingest:** An invoice document (as text) is submitted to the system.  
  * **Process:** An LLM extracts key fields: vendor\_name, invoice\_id, due\_date, total\_amount.  
  * **Validate & Route:**  
    * If all fields are extracted with high confidence and total\_amount is less than $1,000, the workflow proceeds to the "Finalized" state.  
    * If any field is missing or the total\_amount exceeds $1,000, the workflow is paused and moved to a "Pending Human Review" state.  
  * **Human Intervention:** A user reviews the flagged invoice, corrects the data, and approves it.  
  * **Resume & Finalize:** The workflow resumes from its checkpoint with the corrected data and moves to the "Finalized" state.  
* **Example B: Customer Support Ticket Analysis**  
  * **Ingest:** A customer email is submitted.  
  * **Process:** An LLM extracts sentiment, topic, and urgency.  
  * **Validate & Route:** If sentiment is "Irate" or topic is "Security Vulnerability," the workflow is immediately paused for human review. Otherwise, it is auto-assigned and finalized.

**4.2. Out of Scope for Version 1.0**

* Direct ingestion from email servers or cloud storage (input will be via a simple script).  
* User authentication/authorization for the validation UI.  
* Support for persistence backends other than SQLite.  
* Batch processing (workflows are triggered one-by-one).  
* Advanced analytics or a reporting dashboard.

### **5\. Features & Requirements**

#### **Epic 1: The Core Workflow Graph**

* **Story 1.1: State Definition:** As Alex, I can define a TypedDict state schema in LangGraph that tracks a document's id, content, status (\[received, processing, pending\_review, finalized, error\]), extracted\_data, and a log of workflow\_history.  
* **Story 1.2: Intake Node:** As Alex, I can implement an intake node that receives raw document content, creates a unique thread\_id for it, and initializes the workflow state.  
* **Story 1.3: Data Extraction Node:** As Alex, I can implement an extract\_data node that uses an LLM with function-calling capabilities to populate the extracted\_data field in the state. The prompt will be engineered for structured JSON output.  
* **Story 1.4: Validation Router:** As Alex, I can implement a conditional edge that inspects the extracted\_data. It must route the workflow to the await\_human\_review node if specific business rules are met (e.g., missing data, values outside a threshold) and to the finalize node otherwise.  
* **Story 1.5: Finalization Node:** As Alex, I can implement a finalize node that marks the workflow's status as "finalized" and writes the validated data to a designated output (e.g., a JSON file or console log). This is the graph's terminal node.

#### **Epic 2: Persistence, Interruption & Fault Tolerance**

* **Story 2.1: Persistent Checkpointing:** As Alex, I can compile the StateGraph with a SqliteSaver checkpointer, ensuring that the complete state of the workflow is saved to a local SQLite database after every node transition.  
* **Story 2.2: Programmatic Interruption:** As Alex, I can configure the await\_human\_review node to programmatically interrupt execution. The system should gracefully stop processing for that thread, leaving its state perfectly preserved in the database.  
* **Story 2.3: State Resumption:** As Alex, after a workflow has been interrupted, I can programmatically load its state, update it with new data, and resume the graph execution from the exact point it was paused.  
* **Story 2.4: Crash Recovery:** As an operator, if the main Python application crashes and is restarted, no in-flight workflows are lost. The application can correctly resume any interrupted workflow once human approval is provided.

#### **Epic 3: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation UI**

* **Story 3.1: Review Queue Dashboard:** As a human validator, I can open a Streamlit web application and see a simple, real-time list of all documents currently in the "Pending Human Review" state. The list should display the document ID and the reason for the review.  
* **Story 3.2: Document Review Interface:** As a human validator, when I select an item from the queue, the UI displays the original document content side-by-side with the AI-extracted data fields. Fields that triggered the review should be visually highlighted.  
* **Story 3.3: Data Correction & Approval:** As a human validator, I can edit, correct, and fill in the values in the data fields. An "Approve & Resume" button must be present.  
* **Story 3.4: Workflow Resumption Trigger:** As a human validator, when I click "Approve & Resume," the Streamlit application updates the corresponding workflow's state in the SQLite database with my corrected data and triggers the resumption of the LangGraph execution. The item should then disappear from my review queue.

### **6\. System Architecture**

1. **Submission Script (submit.py):** A simple command-line Python script to send a new document into the workflow.  
2. **AI Workflow Engine (engine.py):** The core LangGraph application. This is a long-running process that executes the graph. It does not expose a direct API but is driven by changes in the state database.  
3. **Persistence Layer (workflow.db):** A single SQLite database file that acts as the single source of truth for all workflow states. It is the communication layer between the engine and the UI.  
4. **Validation UI (ui.py):** A standalone Streamlit application. It reads from and writes to workflow.db to display the review queue and submit approvals.

### **7\. Success Metrics**

* **Time-to-Run:** A developer following the README.md can successfully clone, set up, and run the entire end-to-end workflow (submit \-\> review \-\> finalize) in under 20 minutes.  
* **Resilience Demonstration:** The system can successfully recover and complete a workflow after the core engine.py process is killed and restarted during the "Pending Human Review" state.  
* **Code Clarity:** A developer with backend experience but no LangGraph experience can understand the core concepts of checkpointing and interruption by reading the code and its comments.  
* **Community Adoption (Post-Launch):** The GitHub repository achieves 100+ stars within the first month, indicating its value as a learning resource and boilerplate.

### **8\. Future Considerations (V2 Roadmap)**

* **API-driven Architecture:** Decouple the components by introducing a FastAPI layer to manage workflows, replacing direct DB access from the UI.  
* **Alternative Backends:** Provide guides or branches for using more robust backends like PostgreSQL or Redis.  
* **Containerization:** Provide a docker-compose.yml file for one-click setup of the entire application stack.  
* **Observability:** Integrate with LangSmith for detailed tracing and debugging of the graph's execution.
